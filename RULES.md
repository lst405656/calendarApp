# Documentation Maintenance

- Whenever you add a new feature, modify the architecture, or change the build/configuration, you MUST update `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` to reflect these changes.
- Keep the `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` file up-to-date as the single source of truth for the project's technical overview.
